# Flutter Multi-Form Application with Input Validation

This Flutter application demonstrates a multi-screen form with input validation. Users input their Name, Email, and Phone Number on Screen 1, and the validated data is displayed on Screen 2.

## Features

### Screen 1:
- Input fields for Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- Validation:
  - Name field cannot be empty.
  - Email must be in a valid format.
  - Phone Number must be exactly 10 digits.
- Red error messages for invalid input.
- "Next" button to navigate to Screen 2 upon successful validation.

### Screen 2:
- Displays validated user input in a visually appealing card layout.
- Icons representing Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- "Back" button to return to Screen 1.

## Styling
- Gradient background (blue to purple).
- Rounded corners and shadows for input fields and cards.
- Consistent button styling for a modern UI/UX experience.
